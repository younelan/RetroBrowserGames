# H.E.R.O. (Atari 2600 Classic Rewrite in JavaScript)

## Overview
This project is a modern rewrite of the classic Atari 2600 game **H.E.R.O.** (Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation) using JavaScript. The game features a square play area where the player controls Roderick Hero, a rescue worker equipped with a "Mole Module" backpack. The goal is to navigate underground mines, rescue trapped miners, and avoid hazards like lava, cave-ins, and enemies.

## Gameplay
- **Player Control**: The player controls Roderick Hero, who can fly, drill, and use dynamite to navigate and clear obstacles.
- **Objective**: Rescue miners trapped in hazardous underground mines.
- **Mole Module Abilities**:
  - **Flight**: Smooth vertical and horizontal movement.
  - **Drilling**: Drill through certain types of rock to create pathways.
  - **Dynamite**: Clear obstacles and destroy enemies.
- **Hazards**: Lava flows, cave-ins, enemies (spiders, bats), and water hazards.
- **Rescue Mechanics**: Locate trapped miners and guide them to the surface.
- **Health and Lives**: Implement a health system and limited lives.
- **Scoring**: Score based on rescue time, enemies destroyed, and hazards avoided.

## Controls (Mobile-First)
- **Touch Controls**: 
  - **Movement**: On-screen joystick for smooth flight and walking.
  - **Actions**: Buttons for drilling, using dynamite, and interacting with miners.
  - **Pause**: A pause button to access the game menu.
- **Keyboard Controls** (for desktop):
  - **Movement**: Arrow keys or `WASD` for flight and walking.
  - **Actions**: `Space` for drilling, `Shift` for dynamite, `Enter` for interacting with miners.
  - **Pause**: `Esc` to pause the game.

## Game Area
- **Square Play Area**: The game area is a square grid, ensuring consistent gameplay across mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Responsive Design**: The game area scales dynamically to fit the screen size, maintaining aspect ratio and playability.
- **Screen Transitions**: Seamless transitions between screens as the player moves through the mine, with instant loading of the next screen when reaching the edge.

## Features to Implement
1. **Square Play Area**: Create a grid-based square play area for each level.
2. **Hero Movement**: Implement smooth flight, drilling, and dynamite mechanics.
3. **Enemy AI**: Design enemy behavior to patlrol or chase the hero.

7. **Time Limit**: Add a countdown timer for each level.
8. **Boss Battles**: Create unique boss encounters for each level.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: JavaScript
